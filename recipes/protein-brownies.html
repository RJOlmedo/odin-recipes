        <p>A friend of mine was recently diagnosed with liver cancer and her diet became more restrictive. After doing some research, I found that more protein could help so I came up with these so that she could have a relatively healthy treat with her healthy diet.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup mixed nuts</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup flaxseed oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ounces 70% dark chocolate, broken into small pieces</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Spread mixed nuts onto a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Toast in preheated oven until nuts start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Mix brown sugar, flaxseed oil, and butter together in a bowl until creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract. Add 2/3 cup toasted nuts, almond flour, cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, dark chocolate, and baking powder; mix batter well.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup toasted nuts on top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
